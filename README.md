Welcome to No Thoughts WUG Empty! This is a typing survival game with a strong emphasis on wugs. Keep your neurons alive by making nonsense words for as long as you can! But eventually we all end up back with no thoughts, and an empty wug. Good luck out there fellow wuggians!

### How do I play the game?!?
Download and open up the godot engine. Import the code for No Thoughts WUG Empty, and click the play button! Other possible methods of play coming soon????
