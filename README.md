Welcome to No Thoughts WUG Empty! This is a typing survival game with a strong emphasis on wugs. Keep your neurons alive by making nonsense words for as long as you can! But eventually we all end up back with no thoughts, and an empty wug. Good luck out there fellow wuggians!

### How do I play the game?!?
Download and open up the godot engine. Import the code for No Thoughts WUG Empty, and click the play button! Other possible methods of play coming soon????

### What is this game?
No Thoughts WUG Empty is a Two-Dimensioal game that is played by typing in the letter nodes that are connected by edges to make a string of letters. Once you make one connection, you can press enter to submit the word and your score will display in the bottom left corner. 

Congrats! You made your first nonsense word. Keep making more nonsense words to build and create stronger edges. Beware, the edges begin to decay after you submit your first word. The longer you play, the faster the edges decay.

The difficulty doesn't stop at decreasing edges, though. Once you approach a score of 200, the Wug begins getting sleepy... When the Wug falls asleep, the entire screen is darkened and you are left to continue making connections, but only with the help of a flashlight to see the nodes. Luckily, the Wug will wake up again and the entire screen will go back to normal. However, the higher the score, the more the Wug will doze off into slumber. He's trying, okay?!

Get as high of a score as you can and don't let the Wug down!
